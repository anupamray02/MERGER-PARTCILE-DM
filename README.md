# MERGER-PARTICLE-DM
Continued accumulation of non-annihilating particle DM in the compact objects can lead to low mass Black Hole formation. These low mass BHs are commonly known as Transmuted Black Holes (TBHs), a viable alternative to Primordial black holes, and provide a non-primordial solution to sub-Chandrasekhar mass BHs. We compute the required DM mass and DM-nuclei scattering cross section for which succesful transmutations occur for both bosonic and fermionic DM.
Futhermore, we compute the merger rate for TBH binaries, and demonstrated that the merger rate of TBH binaries behave very differntly (as compare to the merger rate of PBH binaries) at high redshifts. Imminent GW experiments are sensitive to these high-redshift binary merger rates, and hence can shed light on particle DM properties.
