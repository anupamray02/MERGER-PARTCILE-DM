# MERGER-PARTICLE-DM
Continued accumulation of non-annihilating particle DM in the compact objects can lead to low mass Black Hole formation. These low mass BHs, commonly known as Transmuted Black Holes (TBHs), can provide a non-primordial solution to sub-Chandrasekhar mass BHs. We compute the required DM mass and DM-nuclei scattering cross section for which TBHs can form for both bosonic and fermionic DM.

We provide several avenues to test the origin (primordial/transmuted) of the low mass BHs, concentrating on the comsic eveloutioin of the binary merger rates. We compute the merger rate for TBH binaries, and demonstrated that the merger rate of TBH binaries behave very differntly (as compare to the merger rate of PBH binaries) at high redshifts. These high-redshift binary merger rates can be measured by the imminent GW experiments, and hence they can shed light on particle DM properties.
